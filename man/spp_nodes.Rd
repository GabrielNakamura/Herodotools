\name{spp_nodes}
\alias{spp_nodes}
\title{Species and their respective ancestral nodes}
\usage{
spp_nodes(tree, node.prefix = "N")
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{Phylogenetic tree}

\item{node.prefix}{Character indicating the prefix to be used to name nodes, default is the letter "N"}
}
\value{
A matrix with species in lines and nodes in columns. 1 indicates that the node corresponds to the ancestor of that species and zero indicates that species
does not share the ancestor node
}
\description{
This function computes a matrix containing species and their respective ancestral nodes
}
\details{
This is an auxiliary function that, by taking a phylogenetic tree, allows to represent in a matrix format
the relationship between present-day species (tips) and their ancestors (nodes). The function provides an
easy way to obtain certain objects that can be used in other functions, like \code{\link{compute_ancestral_state}}
}
\examples{
data(akodon_newick)
spp_nodes(tree = akodon_newick, node.prefix = "N")

}
