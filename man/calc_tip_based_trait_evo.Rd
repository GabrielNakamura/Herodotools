\title{Tip-based metrics of trait evolution}
\usage{
calc_tip_based_trait_evo(
  tree,
  trait,
  nsim = 1,
  method = c("transition_rates", "last_transition_time", "stasis_time")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylogenetic tree as an object of class "phylo"}

\item{trait}{A named vector containing the tip states for a discretely valued character. The names must match the tip labels of the tree.}

\item{nsim}{Number of simulations to stochastic character mapping.}

\item{method}{Tip-based metric, partial match to "transition_rates", "last_transition_time" and "stasis_time".}
}
\value{
A list (length equal to nsim) with tip-based metrics estimated per species.
}
\description{
Tip-based metrics of trait evolution
}
\details{
This function calculates three metrics that represent the macroevolutionary dynamic of traits for each species in a phylogenetic tree. They are
Transition rates, last transition time and stasis time, all originally proposed in Luza et al (2021). \emph{Transition rates} indicate how many
times the ancestral character has changed over time. \emph{Stasis time} indicates the maximum branch length (time interval)
which the current tip-character was maintained across the whole phylogeny. Finally, \emph{last transition time} is the sum of branch lengths
from the tip to the previous node with a reconstructed character equal to the current tip-character. Originally the function
uses a stochastic character mapping on discrete trait data, but other types of trait reconstruction can be used.
