\title{Affiliation of assemblages based on phylogenetic turnover}
\usage{
calc_affiliation_evoreg(phylo.comp.dist, groups)
}
\arguments{
\item{phylo.comp.dist}{A distance matrix indicating the phylogenetic (or taxonomic/functional) distance composition
among assemblages}

\item{groups}{A character vector indicating the group of each assemblage. This object can be obtained with
\code{\link{evoregions}}}
}
\value{
A list with two matrix, one containing affiliation values and the group in which each cell
is classified and the other containing cell coordinates
}
\description{
Affiliation of assemblages based on phylogenetic turnover
}
\details{
The function calculates the degree of affiliation of each community to the region (or evoregion), in which
that community was classified. If used coupled with a analysis of Principal Coordinates of Phylogenetic Structure (PCPS)
to represent the phylogenetic distances the analysis output of the analysis will represent the degree of membership
of assemblages to each evoregion, as described in Maestri and Duarte 2020.
